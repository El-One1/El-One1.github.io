- Workshop paper - <a href="/Hyper-Optimization.pdf" alt="CV" target="_blank">Deep Learning Frontiers: Hyper-Optimization and Learnable Parameters - 2023</a> - My team and I dive into the world of hyper-optimization and propose new techniques to leverage online hyperparameter tuning. We also propose a new activation function - a learnable GeLU - outperforming GeLU on all tested benchmarks. Experiments are limited and require further studies.
- Project paper - <a href="/Visiomel.pdf" alt="CV" target="_blank">Mixing weakly supervised and self-supervised
learning techniques for melanoma relapse detection - 2023</a> My team and I tackle the Visiomel challenge and develop a two-stages process to diagnose melanoma relapse probability from real ultra-high resolution images from french hospitals. We first leverage ByOL to learn informative representations from smaller patches of large patients' images, we then use an attention-base multi-instance learning framework to predict from all those patches at the whole-slice level. We unofficially obtain metrics over the winners of the challenge - though we do not account for all practical considerations in our work.
